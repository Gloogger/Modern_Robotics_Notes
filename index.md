The notes here are taken for the Coursera course [Modern Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics). The MOOC is created by Northwestern University, and in its [homepage](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics) one could download the corresponding textbook and exercise book for free. 

There have been some fine and meticulous summary of the theory part of the **Modern Robotics** course——Muchen Sun's [Course Notes](https://muchensun.github.io/ModernRoboticsCourseNotes/index.html) to name but a few. However, attempts and discussions with regards to the textbook exercises (in which no solutions are published) have not received much attention. Therefore, the content of these notes (which is just a poor imitation to Muchen's Notes) will be focusing exclusively on the textbook exercises. Since there are no solutions available, please be critical about my workings! Also, in line with the [Cousera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) Term 3, it is not allowed to share any notes directly related to the Coursera quizzes and assignments, thus the notes will not cover the aforesaid materials (but there will be some 'general' discussion).

The kinematics theory favored by the **Modern Robotics**  course is _**Product-of-Exponentials (PoE)**_. There is an alternative kenematic theory called _**Denavit-Hartenburg Method (D-H method)**_, which does not gain much attention in this course. If you are interested, there is a free online course called [RoboGrok](http://robogrok.com/) which addresses the D-H method in more detail.
