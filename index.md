title: 'Modern Robotics Course Notes'
description: Salvete discipulae et discipuli

The notes here are taken for the Coursera course [Modern Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics). The MOOC is created by Northwestern University, and in its [homepage](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics) one could download the corresponding textbook and exercise book for free. The content of these notes are mainly about the textbook exercises, in which unfortunately no solutions are provided for these exercises, so be critical about my workings! Also, in line with the [Cousera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) Term 3, it is not allowed to share any notes directly related to the Coursera quizzes and assignments. Though I'd reckon some generalized discussion would be just fine.
