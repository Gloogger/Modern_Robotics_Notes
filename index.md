title: 'Modern Robotics Course Notes'
description: Salvete discipulae et discipuli

The notes here are taken for the Coursera course [Modern Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics). The MOOC is created by Northwestern University, and in its [homepage](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics) one could download the corresponding textbook and exercise book for free. The content of these notes are mainly about the textbook exercises, in which unfortunately no solutions are provided for these exercises, so be critical about my workings! Also, in line with the [Cousera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) Term 3, it is not allowed to share any notes directly related to the Coursera quizzes and assignments. Though I'd reckon some generalized discussion would be just fine.

The kinematics theory favored by the **Modern Robotics**  course is Product-of-Exponentials (PoE). There is an alternative kenematic theory called Denavit-Hartenburg Method (D-H method), which is not discussed in detail in this course. If you are interested in D-H method, there is a free online course called [RoboGrok](http://robogrok.com/) that focuses exclusively on D-H method. However, RoboGrok put more emphasis on application instead of the theory, so it will not discuss the theory in depth as Modern Robotics.
