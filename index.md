title: 'Modern Robotics Course Notes'
description: Salvete discipulae et discipuli !

The notes here are taken for the Coursera course [Modern Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics). The MOOC is created by Northwestern University, and in its [homepage](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics) one could download the corresponding textbook and exercise book for free. 

There have been some fine and meticulous summary of the theory part of the _**Modern Robotics**_ course————Muchen Sun's [Course Notes](https://muchensun.github.io/ModernRoboticsCourseNotes/index.html) to name but a few. However, attempts and discussions with regards to the textbook exercises (in which no solutions are published) have not received much attention. Therefore, the content of these notes (which is just a poor imitation to Muchen's Notes) will be focusing exclusively on the textbook exercises. Since there are no solutions available, please be critical about my workings! Also, in line with the [Cousera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) Term 3, it is not allowed to share any notes directly related to the Coursera quizzes and assignments. Though I'd reckon some generalized discussion about the related topic would be just fine.

The kinematics theory favored by the **Modern Robotics**  course is Product-of-Exponentials (PoE). There is an alternative kenematic theory called Denavit-Hartenburg Method (D-H method), which is not discussed in detail in this course. If you are interested in D-H method, there is a free online course called [RoboGrok](http://robogrok.com/) that focuses exclusively on D-H method. However, RoboGrok put more emphasis on application instead of the theory, so it will not discuss the theory in depth as Modern Robotics.
